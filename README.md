# CSS Transformation Challenge 2

Use the rotate function to spin an image infinitively. The image should rotate without any breaks and stops.
Dont forget to give the animation a name!

#### What i learned!

I used the picture link as an element and not a class.
In the keyframe I learned that it "goes from" 0 to 360 degrees when it spins.
